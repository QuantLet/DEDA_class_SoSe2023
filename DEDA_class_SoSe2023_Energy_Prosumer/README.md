Published in: DEDA class SoSe2023

Description: Prosumers play a crucial role in the energy sector by combining consumer and producer roles. Through our project, we aim to leverage data-driven analysis to empower prosumers and gain insights into their energy usage patterns. By analyzing the behavior and consumption patterns of prosumers, we can identify opportunities for optimizing energy flows, increasing efficiency, and reducing costs. This data-driven approach allows us to develop strategies tailored to individual prosumer needs, such as implementing energy storage systems, demand-side management techniques, and integrating heat pumps to energy systems.
