Name of Quantlet: 'DEDA_SoSe23_HU_NBA_SHAP_Modelling_Predict_NBA_Game_Outcome'

Published in: 'DEDA class SoSe23'

Description: 'Modelling of three different models (log. Regression, decision tree, xgboostcl) to predict game outcome of 40.000 NBA games with 8 predictors, called Dean's factors. Additionally, the performance of the model is evaluated through cross validation and their respective ROC curves. Trained models are provided as .pkl files.'

Keywords: 'logistic regression, decision tree, xgboost classifier, model evaluation, AUC, ROC'
